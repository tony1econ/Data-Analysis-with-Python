# Data-Analysis-with-Python

Here are a series of problem sets I completed from the course Computational Methods in the Economics department at University of San Francisco. They are in .ipynb form as completed in Juniper Notebook. This course introduces students to computational methods using Python. The main focus of the course is on solving optimization problems. We begin with core programming concepts and conclude with maximum likelihood estimation. We also discuss key principles in writing fast and readable code. Working through these 5 problem sets will give you an understanding of using python scripting language for data anylsis.
